## Next and Upcoming Meetings
**Wednesday, February 18 12PM/EST** Zoom Link: To follow shortly

_44 Years to Clear Your Backlog: The Math That Doesn't Add Up_ with guest speaker: [Bruce Fram](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bruce-fram/)

Your vulnerability backlog isn't shrinking—it's growing, and the math is brutal. At typical enterprise fix rates, you'll clear your backlog sometime around 2069, assuming AI hackers don't find everything first. Meanwhile, developers are "vibe coding" with AI assistants that introduce security issues in 24.7% of generated code, making the problem worse. Join Bruce Fram for a look at why manual remediation can't scale and how to implement an automated code fix program that dramatically drives down the cost of the $5,000+ enterprises spend to fix a single vulnerability. Attendees will receive a free copy of Bruce’s new book, “The AI Security Advantage”. Bruce was the founding CEO of Contrast Security and is the CEO of AppSecAI.

_AI Changed the Threat Model: Rethinking Application Security in 2026_ with guest speaker: [Caroline Wong](https://www.linkedin.com/in/carolinewmwong/)

AI is reshaping how applications are built—and how they’re attacked. From AI-assisted vulnerability discovery to automated exploitation and prompt injection risks, traditional AppSec assumptions no longer hold. This session examines how AI is accelerating both offensive and defensive capabilities, where organizations are most exposed today, and how security teams can adapt their application security strategies to keep pace with rapidly evolving threats.
